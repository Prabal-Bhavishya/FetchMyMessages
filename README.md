This is a very basic GITTER app written in Python using Tkinter and GITTER API.

How to run?

Run GitterPythonMain.py, it will ask for Personal Access Token (This token is used to access the Gitter API)
and can be found here https://developer.gitter.im/docs/rest-api

Click on login and then a key (huge random looking string) should appear.

Enter the key in the apps textbox, then select the room and messages will be fetched. :wink:

The messages in green are read and the ones in red colour are unread.
